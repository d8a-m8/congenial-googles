"how can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?"

"in order to make these changes i used the git shell, at first, then connected Rstudio, git, and github. the first two lines (3 - 4) were added using the git shell. the quote about the mirrors and eyes was added like this paragraph, through Rstudio and its console. i believe at one point i looked at sourcetree, but didn't really do anything with it. if i can manage to only use Rstudio and the github website, i will be content."

"the tutorials were a help, better if i followed along in class and did not do this afterwards. trying to remember little details that are not included in the slides, but are hidden (not clandestinly) in the test of happygitwithr. actually reading the text and not skimming over it turned out to be really helpful....who would have thought...regardless, good job with the out-of-class tutorial. THANKS!!!"
